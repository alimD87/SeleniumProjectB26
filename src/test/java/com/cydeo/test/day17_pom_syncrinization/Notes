Today's schedule : - Actions practice
                   - Page Object Model (POM)
                   - Syncronization


===============================================================================

  - src
        - main --> as a tester we don't need it and we deleted.
        - test
          - java
           - com.cydeo
             - test
               - base
             - utilities
             - pages
 - configuration.properties
 - pom.xml


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The reason we have created different packages, and different utility classes, different type of file (.properties) are
    - re-usability
    - to organize our code
    - less code
    - efficient
    - easy to maintain
    - to centralize
    - avoid hard coding


#1- configuration.properties : to centralize and avoid hard coding some of the important test data
#2- TestBase: we can centralize and re-use setup/teardown methods, some important variables and objects etc.
#3- ConfigurationReader : to be able to repeatedly and easily read from our configuration.properties file
#4- Driver : to be able to instantiate our object in less line of code and also be able to steadily pass the same driver instance around in our project
#5- BrowserUtils : to centralize and easy to re-use some of the general utility methods
    - utility methods that are not specific to one page and can be applied in different pages

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page Object Model Design Pattern (POM)

#1- WHAT IS Page Object Model Design Pattern?

    - Creating java class for each page of the web application.
    - All of the related web elements to current page will be stored to its own .java class.
    - We can also store related re-usable utility methods in its "page" class as well.


- We have centralized pretty much everything re-usable such as:
    - important test data: in our configuration.properties
    - utility methods in utilities packages under different classes
        - Driver
        - ConfigurationReader
        - BrowserUtils
- The only thing that we didn't centralize or create a structure around is LOCATING WEB ELEMENTS.
- PAGE OBJECT MODEL DESIGN PATTERN SOLVES THIS ISSUE WE CURRENTLY HAVE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- How are we going to implement POM Design Pattern?

#1- Every time we create a java class for a new page of our application, we will initialize our driver instance and the object that class.

    - PageFactory.initElements(Driver.getDriver() , this); --> // PageFactory is a selenium class that support Page Object Model
                                                               // and it has method called initElements
                                                               // once it's called , it will locate all the element
                                                               // specified using @FindBy annotation with locator
                                                               // initElements accept 2 arguments ,
                                                               // WebDriver instance and Page class instance (this) means current instance of this class.

    - This method basically initializes the driver instance and the object of the class.
    - After this line we will be able to use THE OBJECT of the class, to reach the available web elements.

#2- Instead of using .findElement method we will use @FindBy annotation

- When we implement POM Design pattern we solve StaleElementReferenceException by default.

- How it works?
    - Every time we want to use WebElement located using @FindBy annotation, it will be re-located in the line we are using it.
    - Basically it will automatically do a "freshness check" which will eliminate the StaleElementReferenceException

=============================================================================


  --- SYNCHRONIZATION ---

- What is synchronization? Why do we need it?

- Definition: Multiple things working at the same time.
- We need synchronization because we need to make sure our driver and our browser are on the same page at all times.

#1- Thread.sleep():
    - This is not coming from Selenium library.
    - This method comes from JAVA library
    - It does not wait for ANY CONDITION TO HAPPEN.
    - It will wait for the given duration no matter what.
